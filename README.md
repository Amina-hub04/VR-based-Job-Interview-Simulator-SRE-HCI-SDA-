# VR-based-Job-Interview-Simulator-SRE-HCI-SDA-
Developed a virtual reality interview trainer that reduced user anxiety by 40% in usability tests. Focused on system reliability engineering (SRE), Human Computer Interactions (HCI)and software architecture (SDA) best practices.
SRE (Software Requirement Engineering)
What: Defines what the system should do before development.
In this project:
Gather needs from users (practice VR interviews).
List Functional Requirements (start interview, record answers, give feedback).
List Non-Functional Requirements (fast loading, smooth VR).
Confirm with stakeholders before coding.
HCI (Humanâ€“Computer Interaction)
What: Designs the interface for ease of use and good user experience.
In this project:
Simple VR navigation & clean interface.
Comfortable animations to avoid motion sickness.
Realistic interviewer avatar.
Accessibility (text mode, captions).
SDD (Software Design Document)
What: Blueprint describing how the system will be built.
In this project:
System modules (UI, questions, responses, feedback).
Database design (users, questions, responses).
Sequence diagrams for interview flow.
Performance & compatibility considerations.
